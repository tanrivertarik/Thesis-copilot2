# Tests

Workspace for automated testing assets that span multiple apps/packages.

## Structure
- `e2e/`: End-to-end test suites targeting critical workflows (onboarding, drafting, export).
- `fixtures/`: Sample documents and prompts used across tests (to be added).

## Next Steps
1. Decide on Playwright vs. Cypress for E2E coverage.
2. Add synthetic data fixtures for AI evaluation harness in a subdirectory.
