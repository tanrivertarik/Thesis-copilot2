# Thesis Copilot Project Overview

Thesis Copilot is an AI-powered academic writing assistant following a "copilot, not autopilot" philosophy. The system helps graduate students structure, draft, and finalize theses using their own uploaded sources.

## Core Architecture
- **Frontend:** React.js with TypeScript, Chakra UI/MUI, TipTap/Slate editor
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js), Firebase Functions or containerized service  
- **Data:** Firebase Firestore + Storage, optional Redis cache
- **AI Provider:** OpenRouter with `gemini/gemini-2.5-pro` and `gemini/gemini-flash`
- **Document Processing:** `pdf-parse`, `langchain`/`lancedb`, `docx` library

## Key Design Principles
1. **Source-Locked AI:** All AI generation must be grounded in user-uploaded sources
2. **Citation Transparency:** Use `[CITE:sourceId]` placeholders for traceable citations
3. **User Control:** Students maintain ownership and editorial control over all content
4. **Academic Integrity:** Prevent hallucinations and ensure proper attribution
