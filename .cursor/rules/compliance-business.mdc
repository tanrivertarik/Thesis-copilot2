# Compliance & Business Model Guidelines

## Academic Compliance Requirements
- **"Copilot, not Autopilot":** Emphasize user control in all messaging and UI
- **Source Attribution:** Transparent citation tracking prevents academic misconduct
- **Privacy Compliance:** FERPA/GDPR alignment, data deletion requests, secure legal review
- **Institutional Trust:** Partner with writing centers, provide usage guidelines

## Pricing Strategy
- **Free Tier:** 1 active project, 10 source uploads, limited exports
- **Pro Tier ($10/month):** Unlimited projects/sources, advanced exports (PDF/LaTeX)
- **Institutional:** Volume licensing with advisor collaboration (future)

## Key Success Metrics
- **Activation Rate:** 65% of users create project + upload ≥1 source within 48 hours
- **Engagement:** ≥5 sections generated per active project monthly
- **Retention:** 45% return rate at 30 days
- **Conversion:** 8% Free-to-Pro upgrade within 60 days
- **Satisfaction:** ≥4.2/5 CSAT after draft generation

## Risk Mitigation Requirements
1. **LLM Cost Management:** Monitor token spend per user, implement usage caps
2. **Academic Integrity:** Add disclaimers encouraging review, restrict to uploaded sources
3. **Export Quality:** Automated formatting tests, manual QA, quick re-export capability
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Maintain privacy policy, institutional approval workflows

## Feature Flag Strategy
- Rollout Should-Have/Could-Have features based on beta feedback
- Maintain manual override to disable AI generation if accuracy drifts
- A/B test onboarding flow improvements

## Operational Monitoring
- Weekly triage of support tickets and user feedback
- Monthly roadmap review incorporating usage analytics
- LLM provider cost optimization (model mix, temperature tuning)
