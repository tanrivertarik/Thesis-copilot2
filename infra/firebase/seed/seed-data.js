    topic: 'The transformative effects of artificial intelligence on personalized learning platforms in higher education',
    researchQuestions: [
      'How does AI-driven personalization affect student engagement in online learning platforms?',
      'What are the measurable learning outcomes when AI tutoring systems are integrated into university curricula?',
      'What ethical considerations arise from AI-based student performance prediction and intervention systems?'
    ],
    thesisStatement: 'AI-powered educational technology significantly enhances student learning outcomes through personalized instruction, but requires careful ethical oversight to protect student privacy and prevent algorithmic bias.',
    citationStyle: 'APA',
    constitution: {
      scope: 'This research focuses on AI applications in higher education, specifically examining personalized learning platforms, AI tutoring systems, and predictive analytics tools used in university settings. The study will analyze quantitative learning outcomes, student engagement metrics, and qualitative feedback from both students and educators. The scope excludes K-12 education applications and focuses primarily on undergraduate and graduate-level implementations.',
      toneGuidelines: 'This thesis should maintain an objective, analytical academic tone appropriate for educational technology research. Use clear, precise language that is accessible to both education and technology professionals. Emphasize evidence-based conclusions supported by empirical data. Citations should follow APA format consistently, with particular attention to recent developments in AI and education technology literature.',
      coreArgument: 'The central argument posits that artificial intelligence represents a paradigm shift in educational technology that enhances learning outcomes through personalization, but success depends on thoughtful implementation that addresses ethical concerns. The thesis will demonstrate that while AI-driven systems show measurable improvements in student performance and engagement, their deployment must include robust privacy protections and bias mitigation strategies to realize their full educational potential.',
