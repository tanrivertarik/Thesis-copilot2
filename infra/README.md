# Infrastructure

Phase 0 infrastructure focuses on Firebase resources and local developer tooling. Additional subdirectories will cover deployment pipelines and observability integrations as they come online.

## Directories
- `firebase/`: Hosting configuration, security rules, function settings.
- `observability/`: Logging/metrics configuration (e.g., OpenTelemetry, dashboards).

## Next Steps
1. Export the Firebase project settings and add emulator configuration files.
2. Draft CI/CD templates for deploying the API and web app.
