# Enhanced Drafting Service Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented advanced drafting capabilities to improve source retrieval relevance, context window management, and citation formatting through enhanced retrieval algorithms and sophisticated prompting strategies.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Enhanced Retrieval Service (`enhanced-retrieval-service.ts`)

**Multi-Factor Scoring Algorithm:**
- **Semantic Similarity** (40%): Cosine similarity with query embeddings
- **Recency Score** (15%): Time-based relevance (baseline for current schema)
- **Source Reliability** (20%): Based on metadata quality and structure
- **Contextual Relevance** (20%): Section objective alignment and keyword overlap
- **Diversity Bonus** (5%): Prevents over-clustering from single sources

**Advanced Features:**
- Contextual chunk classification (primary/supporting/contrasting evidence)
- Intelligent source diversity management
- Query intent analysis for strategy optimization
- Comprehensive scoring explanations for transparency
- Fallback mechanisms for robust operation

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
performEnhancedRetrieval(context, maxChunks): Promise<EnhancedRetrievalResponse>
analyzeQueryIntent(query): Promise<IntentAnalysis>
scoreChunksWithMultipleFactors(chunks, queryEmbedding, context, weights): Promise<ChunkScore[]>
```

### 2. Enhanced Drafting Service (`enhanced-drafting-service.ts`)

**Improved Section Draft Generation:**
- Integration with enhanced retrieval for better source selection
- Contextual prompt building with organized evidence presentation
- Intelligent token budget management
- Advanced citation extraction and validation

**Enhanced Paragraph Rewriting:**
- Context-aware rewriting with surrounding paragraph analysis
- Citation preservation with strict validation
- Theme extraction for better flow optimization
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
generateSectionDraft(request): Promise<SectionDraftResponse>
generateParagraphRewrite(request): Promise<RewriteDraftResponse>
buildDraftingPrompt(request, retrieval): string
buildRewritePrompt(request, project, context): string
```

### 3. Enhanced Prompting Templates (`enhanced-drafting.ts`)

**Advanced System Prompts:**
- Source fidelity enforcement with strict hallucination prevention
- Citation precision guidelines with proper placement rules
- Academic voice consistency with discipline-appropriate tone
- Evidence integration strategies for natural citation flow

**Prompt Engineering Features:**
- Context window optimization with token budgeting
- Hierarchical evidence organization (primary/supporting/contrasting)
- Constitutional guidance integration for thesis coherence
- Multi-modal instruction formats for different AI models

**Configuration Constants:**
```typescript
CONTEXT_WINDOW_OPTIMIZATION: {
  MAX_TOKENS: { SECTION_DRAFT: 4000, PARAGRAPH_REWRITE: 2000 }
  CHUNK_SELECTION: { PRIMARY_SOURCES: 5, SUPPORTING_SOURCES: 3, CONTRASTING_SOURCES: 2 }
  PROMPT_BUDGETING: { SYSTEM_PROMPT: 500, EVIDENCE_CHUNKS: 2000, ... }
}
```
