# Target Personas

## Persona 1 â€” "The Overwhelmed Graduate" (Primary)
- **Name:** Alex Chen
- **Program:** Sociology MA, Year 2
- **Demographics:** 24 years old, tech-comfortable but non-technical, balances coursework with part-time research assistantship.

### Goals
- Organize dozens of journal articles, reports, and notes into a coherent structure.
- Translate research questions into an argumentative outline and initial draft.
- Produce polished prose without spending days on each paragraph.
- Maintain flawless APA citations to avoid academic misconduct.

### Frustrations
- "I have all these papers, but I don't know how to connect them."
- Intimidation from blank pages leading to procrastination.
- Manual citation tracking drains focus and carries risk of omissions.

### Motivators
- Clear progress indicators and a sense of momentum.
- Assurance that generated text traces back to legitimate sources.
- Tools that integrate with existing academic workflows (Word export, APA).

### Copilot Opportunities
- Provide scaffolding (Thesis Constitution, outline) that removes ambiguity about what to write next.
- Surface source summaries and arguments while drafting to reduce context switching.
- Offer rewrite assistance that honors Alex's edits, letting them co-create with the AI.

## Persona Backlog
- **"The Structured Undergraduate":** Honors students writing their first thesis, requiring more guardrails and academic coaching content.
- **"The Advisory Partner":** Faculty advisor or writing center coach seeking visibility into student progress and the ability to leave feedback (future collaboration features).
