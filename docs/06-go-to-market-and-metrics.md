# Go-To-Market Strategy & Success Metrics

## Launch Phases
### Private Beta (Weeks 13-16)
- Partner with 2–3 university writing centers and graduate student associations.
- Offer onboarding workshops demonstrating Thesis Constitution and drafting flow.
- Collect qualitative feedback via weekly office hours and in-app surveys.

### Public Beta (Weeks 17-20)
- Publish case studies from private beta cohorts.
- Launch content marketing (blog posts, LinkedIn, academic forums).
- Introduce referral program offering one additional active project for each invite.

### General Availability
- Self-serve onboarding with tiered pricing (Free vs. Pro).
- Consider campus-wide licensing for departments after pilot success stories.

## Positioning & Messaging
- Emphasize "Copilot, not autopilot" in all branding.
- Highlight citation accountability and source lock-in.
- Showcase time saved on structuring and drafting without compromising originality.

## Pricing Hypothesis
- **Free Tier:** 1 active project, 10 source uploads, limited exports.
- **Pro Tier ($10/month):** Unlimited projects and sources, advanced exports (PDF/LaTeX), prioritized support.
- **Institutional:** Volume licensing with advisor collaboration tooling (future).

## Success Metrics
- **Activation Rate:** Percentage of new users who create a project and upload ≥ 1 source within 48 hours. Target: 65%.
- **Engagement:** Weekly active users; average number of sections generated per project. Target: ≥ 5 sections per active project per month.
- **Retention:** 30-day return rate. Target: 45%.
- **Conversion:** Free-to-Pro upgrade rate. Target: 8% within first 60 days.
- **User Satisfaction:** In-app CSAT after draft generation. Target: ≥ 4.2/5.

## Instrumentation Plan
- Integrate analytics to log project creation, source uploads, draft generations, exports.
- Trigger post-action surveys (e.g., after export) to capture qualitative feedback.
- Monitor LLM cost per active user to inform pricing adjustments.

## Feedback Loop
- Weekly triage of support tickets and feedback forms.
- Monthly roadmap review incorporating beta learnings.
- Maintain changelog highlighting improvements driven by user input.
