- Firebase emulator setup for isolated development
- Comprehensive error handling validation
- TypeScript compilation and type safety
- Monorepo structure with shared schemas and utilities

## üîÑ Recently Completed (October 2025)
- Enhanced drafting service with improved source retrieval
- Comprehensive error handling system implementation
- Firebase emulator authentication configuration
- Integration testing framework establishment
- Environment configuration for local development

## üöß Current Development Status
- Full-stack application is **operational** in development mode
- All core services integrated and tested
- Firebase emulators provide isolated development environment
- Authentication working with demo user for testing
- API and web app successfully communicating

## üîÑ Next Development Phase
1. **Production Deployment**: Configure production Firebase project and environment
2. **OpenRouter API Integration**: Add API key for AI-powered features
3. **File Upload Pipeline**: Implement signed upload workflow for PDF sources
4. **Advanced Features**: Export pipeline (DOCX/PDF generation), advanced constitution features
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment workflows

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Technical Debt
- Java version warning (Firebase tools recommends JDK 21+)
- PDF upload currently requires OpenRouter API key configuration
- Production Firebase credentials needed for deployment
- Some features depend on external AI service availability
