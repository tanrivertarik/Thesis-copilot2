# Executive Summary

## Product Vision
Thesis Copilot is a "copilot, not autopilot" academic writing assistant that empowers students to structure, draft, and finalize theses by orchestrating AI support around user-provided sources.

## Problem Landscape
- Students accumulate large libraries of articles yet struggle to translate them into outlines and prose.
- Writer's block and perfectionism slow early drafting, causing project delays.
- Manual citation management is error-prone, risking accidental plagiarism.
- Existing tools either generate generic text or over-automate, eroding trust in academic settings.

## Solution Overview
- Guided onboarding produces a Thesis Constitution capturing scope, tone, core argument, and outline.
- Source ingestion extracts text, summarizes key arguments, and builds accurate citations for each document.
- Section Writer drafts thesis sections with transparent placeholder citations tied to uploaded sources.
- Rich-text editor keeps the student in control, with AI rewrite assistance that respects user edits.
- Export pipeline assembles sections into a formatted `.docx` file with bibliography ready for committee review.

## Target Market
Initial focus is on social science and humanities graduate students in North America, partnering with university writing centers and graduate associations to seed adoption.

## Value Proposition
Students regain momentum, reduce cognitive load managing sources, and produce citation-safe drafts faster while maintaining ownership of their ideas.

## Differentiators
- Source-locked prompting prevents hallucination and enforces academic integrity.
- Thesis Constitution provides a living contract for tone and structure across the project.
- Citation placeholders and resolver tooling integrate AI output with human editorial workflows.
- Export pipeline mirrors academic formatting expectations (margins, pagination, title page).

## Success Definition
Within six weeks of beta, 60% of onboarded users should complete a Thesis Constitution, upload at least five sources, and generate two or more thesis sections, with NPS â‰¥ +25 from post-session surveys.
