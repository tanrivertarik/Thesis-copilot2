# Document Editor Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Phase 1: Visual Transformation âœ… COMPLETED

### Google Docs-Style Page Layout
Created a new `DocumentPage` component that transforms the editor into a professional document view:

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… White page with A4 dimensions (21cm x 29.7cm)
- âœ… Gray background (#F3F4F6) for contrast
- âœ… Professional paper shadow effects
- âœ… 2.54cm (1 inch) margins on all sides
- âœ… Academic typography (Times New Roman, 12pt)
- âœ… Double line spacing (2.0) for thesis format
- âœ… Proper paragraph indentation (0.5 inch first line)
- âœ… Academic heading hierarchy (H1-H3 styled)
- âœ… Formatted citations with highlighting
- âœ… Print-friendly CSS

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/routes/editor/components/DocumentPage.tsx` (NEW)
- `apps/web/src/routes/editor/components/TipTapEditor.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/routes/editor/EditorShell.tsx`

**Visual Result:**
The editor now looks like a real academic document with professional formatting, similar to Google Docs or Word.

## Phase 2: Streaming AI Generation âœ… COMPLETED

### Real-Time Token Streaming with Typing Animation

**Backend Implementation:**
1. Created streaming draft service (`drafting-service-streaming.ts`)
2. Added SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint (`/api/drafting/section/stream`)
3. Integrated with OpenRouter's streaming API (Gemini 2.5 Flash)

**Frontend Implementation:**
1. Created `useStreamingDraft` hook for client-side streaming
2. Updated `WorkspaceHome` to use streaming generation
3. Automatic saving of generated draft to Firestore

**How It Works:**
1. User clicks "Start drafting"
2. Evidence is retrieved from uploaded sources
3. AI starts writing in real-time
4. Each token appears immediately (typing animation effect)
5. When complete, draft is saved automatically
6. User is navigated to the editor with full content

**Files Created:**
- `apps/api/src/services/drafting-service-streaming.ts` (NEW)
- `apps/api/src/routes/drafting-stream.ts` (NEW)
- `apps/web/src/lib/hooks/useStreamingDraft.ts` (NEW)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/api/src/routes/index.ts`
- `apps/web/src/routes/workspace/WorkspaceHome.tsx`

**User Experience:**
- Button shows "Generating draft..." with loading spinner
- User sees AI writing content in real-time
- Natural typing animation as tokens stream
- Automatic save and navigation when complete

- Preserve all formatting
- Include citations and references
- **Status:** Not Started

### Phase 7: LaTeX (.tex) Export

- **Status:** Not Started

### Phase 8: PDF Export
- Direct PDF export from editor
- All formatting intact
- Ready for submission
- **Status:** Not Started

---

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Streaming:** OpenRouter API with `stream: true`
- **Model:** `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (Production Gemini 2.5 Flash - Paid)
- **Transport:** Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Storage:** Firestore for draft persistence

### Frontend
- **Editor:** TipTap (ProseMirror-based)
- **Styling:** Chakra UI + Custom CSS
- **Streaming:** Fetch API with ReadableStream
- **State:** React hooks

---

## Next Steps

To continue implementation:

1. **Phase 3-4:** Add structured format and academic styling
2. **Phase 5:** Implement citation transformation
3. **Phase 6-8:** Add export capabilities

**Recommended Libraries for Export:**
- **Word:** `docx` npm package
- **LaTeX:** Custom converter or `latex.js`
- **PDF:** `jsPDF` or `html2pdf.js`

## Testing

To test the current implementation:

1. Start the API: `pnpm --filter @thesis-copilot/api dev`
2. Start the web app: `pnpm --filter @thesis-copilot/web dev`
3. Navigate to workspace
4. Select a section with ready sources
5. Click "Start drafting"
6. Watch the AI write in real-time!
7. See the professional document format in the editor

## Known Issues

- None currently! ðŸŽ‰

## Performance Notes

- Streaming provides immediate feedback (much better UX than waiting)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash is fast, powerful, and cost-effective
- SSE is reliable and well-supported in modern browsers
- Auto-save ensures no content is lost
